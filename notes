1. So far the data files types found are:
* config
* saves
* replays
* screenshots

2. Sometimes multiple file extentions are needed for a single file category.
In such case, an array of extensions is added. See 0AD as example.

3. Sometimes multiple file categories are stored with the same extension.
I'm still not sure what to do in that case. For example, The Battle for
Wesnoth stores both replays and saves under the same extension .gz

4. I wasn't able to install the following games directly from Lutris:
* Warsow
* 0AD
* Wesnoth
I installed the newest versions from the official sites.

5. I made a python script to check if the paths are correct: check.py
